                Just like the hearts are falling,<br>
                I'm falling for you every moment,<br>
                Surrendering to the magic you weave around me.<br><br>

                Your kindness, like a gentle breeze,<br>
                Soothes the storms within me,<br>
                Guiding me home to the warmth of your love.<br><br>

                In your presence, I found peace,<br>
                You sketched my world back into sight,<br>
                Turning faded dreams into a masterpiece of us.<br><br>

                It is said that some lives are linked across time,<br>
                Connected by an ancient calling that echoes through the ages.<br>
                Maybe that's why my soul recognized you before my heart even knew,<br>
                As if I had loved you in lifetimes before, and will love you for lifetimes more.<br><br>

                If you would hold this heart of mine,<br>
                I'd cherish you through endless time.<br><br>

                <strong>Ti amo, Ranju. Sei il mio destino. ❤️✨</strong>
